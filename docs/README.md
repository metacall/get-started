# Introduction

The MetaCall Community Guide is a central repository to direct how beginner contributors can get started with contributing to [MetaCall Core](https://github.com/metacall/core) and the various other projects hosted under MetaCall. This Community Guide serves as a single source of truth and is open to everyone for verification and suggestions of improvements. We use [Issues](https://github.com/metacall/get-started/issues) to ask questions and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/metacall/get-started/pulls) to suggest and add new information.

We welcome every new contributor and we value transparency, openness, diversity and inclusion as an Open-Source community.

## What is MetaCall ?

MetaCall is a cross-platform library that supports the execution and mixing of various programming languages. It makes use of a C API that allows all the runtimes to be embedded into the C programming language for a quick start.

Currently, MetaCall offers **Loaders** and **Ports**. Loaders allow you to load and invoke programming languages from C and embed them. Currently, MetaCall supports Python, NodeJS, TypeScript/JavaScript, C# and Ruby to name a few.

Ports allow you to call MetaCall from other languages and embed them into your code to allow cross-language functionality. MetaCall Core brings forward an interface that is utilized by function calls between programming languages.

MetaCall allows companies to migrate their monolithic architecture to a container-based architecture. MetaCall is currently being utilized to build Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) at [metacall.io](http://metacall.io/) where you can develop, test and deploy the application using an API gateway. With the cross-platform polyglot runtime, you can now inter-mix code samples in different languages and still manage to deploy them.

## History

MetaCall is authored by [Vicente Eduardo Ferrer Garcia](https://github.com/viferga) and was conceptualized during the development of a [cross-platform mmorpg](https://bitbucket.org/parrastudios/argentum-online-c). The primary purpose of the project was to develop an interface that will extend the game engine. The idea was further developed in a thesis titled ["Design and Implementation of the Plug-in Framework for an Advanced Game Engine Architecture"](https://bitbucket.org/parrastudios/argentum-online-c/raw/e6e78fef80c6adc541640d68d422721ef735184f/common/doc/Plugin/plugin-framework-paper.pdf) and the following [presentation](https://bitbucket.org/parrastudios/argentum-online-c/raw/e6e78fef80c6adc541640d68d422721ef735184f/common/doc/Plugin/plugin-framework-presentation.pdf).

Today, MetaCall Core is available as an Open-Source Project under an [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/metacall/core/blob/develop/LICENSE). With the [first release](https://github.com/metacall/core/releases/tag/v0.1.0) of MetaCall back in 2019, the library is continuously being improved and stabilized through a [community of contributors](https://github.com/metacall/core/graphs/contributors). Currently, MetaCall is being used by [Acid Cam](https://github.com/lostjared/acidcam-cli), an Augmented Reality hallucination simulator, [Pragma](https://pragmalang.com/), an Advanced GraphQL Language and plenty of [community examples](https://github.com/metacall/examples).

## Community

As an Open-Source Community, we value contributors from all walks of background and expertise. For common discussions, we rely on various communication channels, which you can join through these resources:

- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/upwP4mwJWa)
- [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/BMSVbBatp0Vi4s5l4VgUgg)
- [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#metacall:matrix.org)

We use a bridge that relays text messages and media files between Discord, Telegram and Matrix. You can join any one of them and get started with your communication.

We have some Community Guidelines that we would like all the contributors to follow for a resourceful experience:

- **Be kind and courteous**: Be kind and respectful to all of the contributors. In Open-Source, we cannot expect all of the collaborators to have similar expertise as you. It would be great to have a welcoming environment that is conducive to community growth. Healthy debates are appreciated but should not take a wrong turn.

- **Be Exact, Be Brief**: If in doubt, we would recommend you to ask. But we would also like to know if you have done any prior research before asking the question. Always follow the STAR method of describing a specific situation, task, action, and result. Don't use unnecessary details as they tend to confuse more, rather than adding any value.

- **Respect Privacy**: In Open-Source, everyone's privacy should be respected. A community is built on top of mutual trust and understanding. The discussions should be authentic and expressive of the overall interest of the community, to make everyone feel safe and valued. Make sure that you give more to the community than you can take.

- **Be Collaborative**: In an Open-Source community, we cannot emphasise more on collaboration. Make sure, whatever you do, should be part of a collaborative effort with a maintainer in the loop to better understand the purpose of your task. Keep transparency at the top of the agenda and remove redundancy, duplication and complexity with overall team effort.

- **Share some Love**: At MetaCall, we are highly appreciative of any outreach that can help us grow. If you have written an example with MetaCall, penned a blog on MetaCall, created a YouTube video on the same, we would be highly appreciative of your efforts. Do share them within the community for everyone to celebrate the collaborative efforts.
